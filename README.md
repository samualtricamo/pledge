# pledge

<p>I, (your name), will take EVERY OPPORTUNITY to advance myself with abandon</p>
<p><i>Good intentions</i> <em>WILL NOT</em> achieve my goals</p>
<p><i>Success</i> is <em>NOT</em> what I know, but <em>WHAT I DO</em> with what I know</p>
<p>I <em>EXPECT</em> and <em>WELCOME</em>, the <i>struggle</i>, the <i>learning</i>, the <i>effort</i>, and the <i>growth</i></p>
<p><i>I understand that my level of success is determined by my level of commitment</em></p>
<p>I will <em>ALWAYS FAVOR ACTION</em> over <i>talking, wishing, hoping, and wondering</i></p>
<p><em>I WILL ALLOW MYSELF</em> to achieve my dreams</p>
<p>I am a <em>FULL STACK DEVELOPER!</em></p>
